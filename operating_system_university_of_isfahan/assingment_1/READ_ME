In this program, I want to run multilevel feedback queue. 
Multilevel feedback queue is an algorithm to manage processes
in operating systems. In the algorithm, we have some queues that 
in each queue, processes are run depend on a perticular order. If 
some processes remain after one queue, they go to the upper queue to 
wait for run.
